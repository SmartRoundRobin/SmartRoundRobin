Project Proposal : Enhancing Performance Through Smart Scheduling
This project proposal outlines our plan to enhance the Round Robin (RR) scheduling algorithm
in operating systems. We will optimize RR and compare its performance with other scheduling
algorithms to determine the impact of these enhancements on system efficiency and overall
operating system performance.
Introduction :
Efficient process scheduling is a critical aspect of modern computing environments. Operating
systems rely on scheduling algorithms to allocate CPU time to processes effectively. This
project aims to improve the Round Robin scheduling algorithm and evaluate its performance
relative to other scheduling algorithms like First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First
(SJF) and Traditional Round Robin....
Project Objectives :
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:
RR Algorithm Enhancement: We will focus on optimizing the Round Robin scheduling algorithm
to distribute CPU time more efficiently and effectively.
Comparative Analysis : We will conduct a comparative analysis of the enhanced Round Robin
algorithm against traditional scheduling algorithms, such as Traditional Round Robin , SJF
(Shortest Job First) , FirstComeFirstServe (FCFS). The goal is to quantify the improvements in
system performance.
Insights and Documentation : This project will provide valuable insights into the impact of Round
Robin scheduling on overall operating system performance. We will document our findings and
share the code for the enhanced Round Robin algorithm as open-source contributions.Scope of Work :
The scope of our project will include the following activities:
Algorithm Enhancement : Optimize the Round Robin scheduling algorithm to improve CPU time
allocation.
Testing and Evaluation : Implement the enhanced Round Robin algorithm in a simulated
